## Writing Your First Test
To create your first test:
1. Navigate to the `cypress/integration` folder.
2. Create a new file, e.g., `first_test.spec.js`.
3. Add the following test:
   ```javascript
   describe('Example Test', () => {
       it('Visits the Cypress example site', () => {
           cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io');
           cy.contains('type').click();
           cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions');
       });
   });
   ```
4. Run the test from the Cypress Test Runner.

## Running Tests

### Using Cypress Test Runner
1. Open Cypress:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```
2. Click on a test file in the Test Runner to execute it.

### Running Tests in Headless Mode
For CI/CD pipelines or faster execution, use:
```bash
npx cypress run
```
